# Contributing to StudyLife Webhooks

Thanks for taking the time. StudyLife Webhooks is a single-maintainer project, so the process is
deliberately small - but it is the same for every change, including the maintainer's own.

## How changes get in

1. Open an issue first for anything bigger than a typo or an obvious bug fix, so the direction can
   be agreed before you spend time on it. Use the templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
2. Fork the repository (or branch, if you have write access) and make your change on a branch.
3. Open a pull request against `main`. The pull-request template asks for what changed and why.
4. `main` is protected: a PR merges only after the test stage of
   [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) is green and the branch is up to date
   with `main` (enable auto-merge and it lands on its own once that is the case). Nobody pushes to
   `main` directly, not even the maintainer.

## What a pull request needs

- **Conventional Commits.** The version and the changelog are generated from the commit messages
  (`feat:` = minor release, `fix:` = patch release, `build:`/`ci:`/`docs:`/`test:` = no release).
  Squash-merge keeps the PR title as the commit message, so give the PR a Conventional Commit
  title.
- **Green required checks.** `lint`, `test` and `review / dependency-review` are required; a red
  one blocks the merge.
- **Tests for new functionality.** New features and bug fixes come with tests in `tests/`
  (`test_db.py`, `test_delivery.py`, `test_main.py`). A PR that adds behaviour without a test is
  asked to add one - delivery and retry behaviour in particular, since a bug there silently drops
  someone's automation.
- **Lint and formatting.** The `lint` job runs `ruff check .` **and** `ruff format --check .`. Run
  both before pushing; `ruff check` passing does not mean the formatting is clean. The README's
  development snippet omits lint entirely, but it is a required check.
- **Lockfile.** CI installs with `uv sync --frozen`, so a dependency change means committing the
  updated `uv.lock` alongside `pyproject.toml`.
- **Signatures and payloads.** Callbacks are signed and consumers verify them. A change to the
  signature scheme or to an event payload is a breaking change for every subscriber - call it out
  in the PR body, and keep `PRIVACY.md` accurate about what leaves the system.

## Running things locally

Python 3.12 or newer, with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run uvicorn studylife_webhooks.main:app --reload
```

The lint gates CI runs:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

The fuzz target is Linux-only (`atheris` publishes no Windows wheel):

```bash
uv sync --frozen --group fuzz
uv run python fuzz/fuzz_publish_event.py -max_total_time=30 -rss_limit_mb=1024
```
